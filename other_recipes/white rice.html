<h1>White rice</h1>
<img src ="white rice img.jpg"width ="30%">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>White rice is milled rice that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed. This alters the flavor, texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage, extend its storage life, and makes it easier to digest.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
<li>2 cups water</li> 
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, optional</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<li>Add rice and water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cover. Ensure it simmering and not boiling or the rice can cook too quickly.</li>


<li>Simmer until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender about 15-25 minutes (will depend on size and freshness of rice). Drain off any excess water if there is any (there shouldnt be).</li>
<li>I like to turn off the heat, remove the lid, fluff with a fork, put the lid back on, and let rest for 10 minutes so the moisture redistributes to prevent mushy rice.</li>
<li>Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-6 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a little oil or water until warm.</li>
